In AP mode you should be able to:
- access config console for AP while connected to both AP or router eg. 192.168.8.9
- access config console for router while connected to both AP or router eg. 192.168.8.1
- connect to the internet when connected to either AP or router

Note: The subnet of the AP must match the subnet of the router in order to access internet and the config page. Eg. 8
Note: For the CPE220 the ethernet cables must be in the correct position, LAN from the POE adapter may not work so the correct positions are Adapter POE to LAN0(POE), and Router LAN to LAN1.
