In AP mode you should be able to:
- access config console for AP while connected to both AP or router eg. 192.168.8.9
- access config console for router while connected to both AP or router eg. 192.168.8.1
- connect to the internet when connected to either AP or router

Note: the subnet of the AP must match the subnet of the router in order to access internet and the config page. Eg. 8
